# Problem 1:

## Mr. Trash Wheel

1.  Load in Mr. Trash Wheel data
2.  omit rows containing NA
3.  round sports balls to an integer:

<!-- end list -->

``` r
mtw <- read_excel("HealthyHarborWaterWheelTotals2018-7-28.xlsx", 
                  sheet = "Mr. Trash Wheel", 
                  range = "A2:N338") %>% 
  drop_na() %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  mutate(sports_balls = as.integer(round(sports_balls)),
         weight_tons = as.numeric(weight_tons))
```

## 2017 and 2018 Rain

1.  Load Precip 2017 and 2018 data
2.  omit NA
3.  Add Year variable
4.  Combine 2017 and 2018 data and convert Month variable to character:

<!-- end list -->

``` r
#2017 and 2018 data:

rain_2018 <- read_excel("HealthyHarborWaterWheelTotals2018-7-28.xlsx",
                   sheet = "2018 Precipitation",
                   range = "A2:B15") %>% 
  drop_na()

rain_2018 <- rain_2018 %>% 
  mutate("Year" = rep("2018", n = nrow(rain_2018))) %>% 
  select(Year, Month, Total)

rain_2017 <- read_excel("HealthyHarborWaterWheelTotals2018-7-28.xlsx",
                   sheet = "2017 Precipitation",
                   range = "A2:B15") %>% 
  drop_na()

rain_2017 <- rain_2017 %>% 
  mutate("Year" = rep("2017", n = nrow(rain_2018))) %>% 
  select(Year, Month, Total)

#combined data:

rain <- rbind(rain_2017, rain_2018) %>% 
  mutate(Month = month.name[Month])

#both year and month variables are characters, 
#could convert to factor or numeric using mutate if necessary.

wt_2017 <- mtw %>% 
  filter(year == 2017)

wt_2018 <- mtw %>% 
  filter(year == 2018)
```

## Data Summary

The **mtw** dataset has *285* observations of *14* variables. Generally,
these variables specify the month and year, amount and types of trash
collected, and the number of homes powered as a result of the trash
collected. The **rain** dataset provides monthly rain totals from
Jan-Dec 2017 and Jan-July 2018, and it has *19* observations of *3*
variables.

The median number of sports balls collected in the year 2017 was *8*.
The amount of trash collected is known to be a function of the amount of
rainfall. The average precipitation from Jan-July 2017 was *2.7441667*,
and from Jan-July 2018 it was *3.3571429*. The average amount of trash
collected from Jan-Nov 2017 was *3.1789091* tons, and from Jan-July 2018
was *3.365* tons. This data suggests that the increased average rainfall
in 2018 also led to an increase in the amount of trash collected
compared to 2017.
