# Problem 1:

## Mr. Trash Wheel

1.  Load in Mr. Trash Wheel data
2.  omit rows containing NA
3.  round sports balls to an integer:

<!-- end list -->

``` r
mtw <- read_excel("Trash-Wheel-Collection-Totals-8-6-19.xlsx", 
                  sheet = "Mr. Trash Wheel", 
                  range = "A2:N338") %>% 
  drop_na() %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  mutate(sports_balls = as.integer(round(sports_balls)),
         weight_tons = as.numeric(weight_tons))
```

## 2017 and 2018 Rain

1.  Load Precip 2017 and 2018 data
2.  omit NA
3.  Add Year variable
4.  Combine 2017 and 2018 data and convert Month variable to character:

<!-- end list -->

``` r
#2018 data:

rain_2018 <- read_excel("HealthyHarborWaterWheelTotals2018-7-28.xlsx",
                   sheet = "2018 Precipitation",
                   range = "A2:B15") %>% 
  drop_na()

rain_2018 <- rain_2018 %>% 
  mutate("Year" = rep("2018", 
                      n = nrow(rain_2018))) %>% 
  select(Year, Month, Total)

#2017 data:

rain_2017 <- read_excel("HealthyHarborWaterWheelTotals2018-7-28.xlsx",
                   sheet = "2017 Precipitation",
                   range = "A2:B15") %>% 
  drop_na()

rain_2017 <- rain_2017 %>% 
  mutate("Year" = rep("2017", 
                      n = nrow(rain_2018))) %>% 
  select(Year, Month, Total)

#combined data:

rain <- rbind(rain_2017, rain_2018) %>% 
  mutate(Month = month.name[Month])

#for year based weight summary:

wt_2017 <- mtw %>% 
  filter(year == 2017)

wt_2018 <- mtw %>% 
  filter(year == 2018)
```

## Data Summary

The **mtw** dataset has *286* observations of *14* variables. Generally,
these variables specify the month and year, amount and types of trash
collected, and the number of homes powered as a result of the trash
collected. The **rain** dataset provides monthly rain totals from
Jan-Dec 2017 and Jan-July 2018, and it has *19* observations of *3*
variables.

The median number of sports balls collected in the year 2017 was *8*.

The amount of trash collected is known to be a function of the amount of
rainfall. The average precipitation from Jan-Dec 2017 was *2.7441667*,
and from Jan-July 2018 it was *3.3571429*. The average amount of trash
collected from Jan-Nov 2017 was *3.1789091* tons, and from Jan-Aug 2018
was *3.3641538* tons. This data suggests that the increased average
rainfall in 2018 also led to an increase in the amount of trash
collected compared to 2017.

# Problem 2:

Load and clean the data:

``` r
pols <- read_csv(file = "fivethirtyeight_datasets/pols-month.csv") %>% 
  separate(col = mon, into = c("year", "month", "day"), sep = "-") %>% 
  mutate(month = as.integer(month), 
         month = month.name[month],
         day = NULL,
         prez_gop = recode(prez_gop, `0` = "dem", `1` = "gop"),
         prez_dem = NULL)%>% 
  pivot_longer(cols = prez_gop, 
               names_to = "delete", 
               values_to = "president") %>%
  mutate(delete = NULL)
```

    ## Parsed with column specification:
    ## cols(
    ##   mon = col_date(format = ""),
    ##   prez_gop = col_double(),
    ##   gov_gop = col_double(),
    ##   sen_gop = col_double(),
    ##   rep_gop = col_double(),
    ##   prez_dem = col_double(),
    ##   gov_dem = col_double(),
    ##   sen_dem = col_double(),
    ##   rep_dem = col_double()
    ## )

    ## Warning: Unreplaced values treated as NA as .x is not compatible. Please
    ## specify replacements exhaustively or supply .default
